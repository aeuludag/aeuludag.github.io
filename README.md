My website made with React and Vite. It's my first project with React, so expect a lot of beginner mistakes if you happen to read the source :D

Currently there are a few projects listed here:
- [Orbit Inspector](https://aeuludag.github.io/#/projects/orbit)
- [Logic Calculator](https://aeuludag.github.io/#/projects/logic)
- [Collatz Conjecture](https://aeuludag.itch.io/collatz)
- [Epik Kaps√ºl](https://aeuludag.itch.io/epik-kapsul)
- MangalAI (soon? perhaps?)
